Product Requirements Document (PRD) for DealVerse OS
1. Introduction
This Product Requirements Document (PRD) outlines the vision, scope, and functional requirements for DealVerse OS, a unified, AI-powered operating system designed to streamline the entire investment banking deal lifecycle. This platform aims to address critical pain points faced by investment bankers, from deal sourcing to post-deal analysis, by integrating various functionalities into a seamless, intelligent workflow. The development of DealVerse OS will leverage advanced AI capabilities to enhance efficiency, reduce manual errors, and transform investment bankers from data processors into strategic advisors.
2. Problem Statement
The investment banking industry is characterized by high stakes, demanding workloads, and complex regulatory environments. Investment bankers, across all levels, face significant inefficiencies and burdens that hinder productivity and increase operational costs. Key pain points include:
⦁	Tedious Manual Data Entry and Research: Investment banking analysts and associates spend considerable time on manual data gathering, financial modeling, and research, often dealing with disparate data sources. This is time-consuming and prone to human error [1].
⦁	Inefficient Due Diligence Processes: The due diligence phase is fundamental but often inefficient, involving extensive document review, data verification from numerous sources, and complex coordination among various internal and external parties [2].
⦁	Inadequate Client Relationship Management (CRM) Tools: Traditional CRM systems or generic spreadsheets often fail to meet the specific and intricate needs of investment banking professionals, making it challenging to track client interactions, understand preferences, and maintain a comprehensive transaction history [3].
⦁	Growing Regulatory Compliance Burden: The highly regulated environment necessitates strict adherence to a complex web of rules (e.g., Dodd-Frank Act, KYC, AML), imposing significant costs and consuming considerable time for compliance and reporting [4].
⦁	Challenges in Deal Origination and Business Development: Identifying potential clients and viable opportunities is a time-intensive process that relies heavily on established networks and manual research. Smaller firms particularly struggle with sourcing new deals and pitching services effectively [5].
⦁	Lack of Integrated Workflow: The current landscape often involves a collection of single-purpose tools, leading to fragmented workflows, redundant work, and a lack of a single source of truth across the deal lifecycle.
These challenges collectively contribute to long working hours, high stress levels, and a reduced focus on strategic decision-making and client interaction for investment bankers.
3. Solution: DealVerse OS
DealVerse OS is envisioned as a comprehensive, modular SaaS web application that integrates key functionalities to address the identified pain points.
